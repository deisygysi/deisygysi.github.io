<!-- this is a subheadline -->

<!-- Currently, I'm a **Associate Research Scientist** at the [**BarabasiLab**](https://www.barabasilab.com/) \@ [Network Science Institute - Northeastern University](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/)) and a **Research Trainee** at [**Channing Division of Network Medicine** (Harvard Medical School / Brigham and Women's Hospital)](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/departments/channing-division-of-network-medicine/about). I'm mostly interested in **biomarker discovery** for complex diseases related to auto-immune response (i.e. as rheumatoid arthritis - RA - and inflammatory bowel disease - IBD), mental disorders (such as autism spectrum disorders, bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD, etc) and senior disorder (Alzheimer and Parkinson). I'm also interested in **drug repurpusing** for those diseases, mostly using a combination of **multi-omic**, **machine learning** and **network analysis** approaches. I'm highly interested in developing methodologies and [**R packages**](/rpackages).

During COVID-19 we decided to use our skills and focus on repurpusing drug candidates for treating this disease, a [publication can be found here](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2025581118). I was also involved with the project that celebrated the [20th anniversary of the Human Genome Project](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00314-6).

I had achieved my bachelor in Biotechnology at the Pontifical Catholic University (2011) and my bachelor in Statistics at the Federal University of Paraná (2012), both in Brazil. During the whole undergraduate time, I was involved in research and received 2 awards for the best undergraduate research. While working on my Bachelor, I was also employed at HSBC multibank as a Risk Analyst.

After that, I worked as a Bioinformatician at the Heart Institute of the University of São Paulo (USP), where I started working with co-expression networks, especially investigating the influence of (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) SNPs on the networks. After finishing that project I joined the Albert Einstein Hospital as a Statistician, where I was a consultant to the research department of the hospital. In October 2015 I started my PhD under the supervision of [Dr Peter Stadler](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/), [Dr Katja Nowick](http://www.nowick-lab.info/?author=1) and [Dr Martin Middendorf](http://pacosy.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/1-1-Home.html) at the University of Leipzig, Germany.

I am a Professor in Statistics <!-- and the leader of the PRIME Lab (Precision Research in Integrative Medicine and Epidemiology Lab) --> at Federal University of Paraná ([UFPR](https://ufpr.br/)). My research revolves around the fascinating field of **Precision Medicine**, where I harness the synergies of **Network Science** and **Machine Learning** to drive transformative advancements.

With a strong background in biomedical research, I am deeply passionate about the potential of *precision medicine to revolutionize healthcare by tailoring treatments to individual patients based on their unique characteristics*. Through my work, I strive to uncover intricate disease mechanisms and identify **targeted therapeutic strategies** that can significantly improve patient outcomes.

Prior to my current position, I held the role of Associate Research Scientist at the renowned [BarabasiLab](https://www.barabasilab.com/), affiliated with the Network Science Institute at **Northeastern University**. Simultaneously, I served as a Research Trainee at the esteemed Channing Division of Network Medicine, associated with **Harvard Medical School** and **Brigham and Women's Hospital,** and as a Bioinformatician at the **Veteran Affairs**. During this period, my primary focus was on biomarker discovery for complex diseases characterized by auto-immune responses, mental disorders, and senior disorders. In addition to that, I am also highly interested in the role of ncRNA mediated interactions for disease diagnostic, progression and terapeutics. Leveraging the power of Network Science and Machine Learning, I developed innovative approaches to decipher the complexities of these conditions and explore avenues for precision interventions.

*Additionally, I actively contributed to the development of methodologies and R packages to facilitate the analysis of complex biomedical data.*

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, my research group redirected our efforts [towards drug repurposing for this pressing health crisis](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2025581118). Our work showcased the successful application of Network Science and Machine Learning in identifying potential drug candidates. This endeavor exemplifies my commitment to utilizing cutting-edge techniques to address urgent healthcare challenges. While celebrating the [20th anniversary of the Human Genome Project in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00314-6) we have learned that ncRNAs have a major potencial for Network Medicine. Unleashing their power in NetMed has now opened a new era for [disease detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14800).

My academic journey commenced with a **Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology** from the **Pontifical Catholic University**, followed by a **Bachelor's degree in Statistics** from the **Federal University of Paraná**, both in Brazil. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in research activities and was honored with two awards for outstanding research projects. Concurrently, I gained valuable experience as a Risk Analyst at HSBC multibank, where I applied statistical methods in a practical setting.

Building on this foundation, I served as a Bioinformatician at the Heart Institute of the **University of São Paulo (USP)**, where I explored co-expression networks and investigated the influence of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) on these networks. Subsequently, I joined the **Albert Einstein Hospital** as a Statistician, offering consulting services to the research department. In pursuit of advanced knowledge, I embarked on a Ph.D. program at the University of Leipzig, Germany, under the guidance of esteemed mentors, [Dr. Peter Stadler](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/), [Dr Katja Nowick](<http://www.nowick-lab.info/?author=1>), and [Dr Martin Middendorf](<http://pacosy.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/1-1-Home.html>).

Driven by my unwavering passion for scientific progress, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of precision medicine. By combining Network Science and Machine Learning, I strive to unlock the full potential of personalized treatments, ultimately improving the lives of patients. I invite you to explore my webpage to learn more about my research, publications, and ongoing projects within the exciting realm of precision medicine.
